# PALETTE Advanced Features Roadmap

Based on the "Monday.com" style reference and the vision for a fully optimized, AI-powered workspace, here is the implementation plan:

## 1. Advanced Table View (The "Monday" Experience) - **CURRENT FOCUS**
*   **Grouped Tasks**: Ability to group tasks into sections (e.g., "Outreach Progress", "Main Table").
*   **Status-Driven UI**: Large, colored status cells (Ready, Pending, Done) with quick-change menus.
*   **Inline Editing**: Click-to-edit for every cell (Task name, Status, etc.).
*   **Custom Columns**: Add columns for "Subitems", "Updates", and "Links" with specific icons.

## 2. Profile & Key Management
*   **Dedicated Profile Page**: A clean UI to manage user identity and preferences.
*   **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Securely store OpenAI and Gemini API keys in local storage.
*   **Usage Monitoring**: Simple indicators to show if keys are active and working.

## 3. "Pal" - The AI Assistant
*   **Context-Aware Chat**: Pal can see your current board and suggest tasks or summaries.
*   **Smart Generation**: Use AI to generate entire boards or task lists based on a prompt.
*   **Multi-Model Support**: Toggle between OpenAI and Gemini depending on your preference.

## 4. Enhanced Board Management
*   **Group Actions**: Move or delete entire groups of tasks.
*   **Advanced Filtering**: "Quick find" search bar at the bottom (as seen in the reference image).
*   **Custom Themes**: Fully customizable color palettes for each board.
